# N-queen-heuristic
The provided code implements a greedy search algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem by iteratively swapping queens based on a heuristic evaluation until a valid solution is found.


1- explian the n queen uisng picture


2- explain greedy method and different methods we used

3-compare them with each other result using picture
